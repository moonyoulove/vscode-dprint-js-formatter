# JS Formatter for DPrint

This is a VSCode extension that uses [js-formatter](https://github.com/dprint/js-formatter) and [dprint](https://github.com/dprint/dprint) to format JavaScript and TypeScript code. It's perfect for projects without a workspace setup, so you don't need to manually download the dprint executable or create a dprint config file in your project.

Thanks to [dprint](https://dprint.dev) for providing this awesome tool. This extension simply wraps their tools into a VSCode extension.
